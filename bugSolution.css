To fix this, use more specific selectors that precisely target the elements you intend to style. Instead of `.container`, use a more specific selector, perhaps by combining classes or using IDs: #container { background-color: blue; } or .container.main { background-color: blue; } This ensures that only the intended elements are styled, avoiding conflicts with elements containing "container" within their class names.
